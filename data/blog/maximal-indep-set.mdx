# Introduction

The following is a solution to a graph optimization problem I encountered during a computer science course.
I found the problem quite interesting, putting a lot of effort into my solution, so I wanted to share it here.
The problem is to design a polynomial time algorithm to find the independent set of largest weight in a graph with weighted verticies. To provide such an algorithm, we were told to assume, the unlikely, $P=NP$, meaning the algorithm could be non-deterministic.
More specifically, we were asked to solve the following optimization problem in polynomial time, where time is measured as a function of the length of the encoding of the input.

Under the assumption that $P=NP$, given a vertex weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$ with $w:V\mapsto \{1, 2, ... ,2^k\}$ for some $k\in \mathbb{Z^+}$, find an independent set $V'\subseteq V$ that maximizes $\sum_{v\in V'}w(v)$.

# Restating the Problem

We can write any graph $G=(V,E)$ as a $|V|\times|V|$ adjacency matrix, meaning we can encode $G$ as the binary string $m_{11}m_{12}...m_{|V|1}...m_{1|V|}...m_{|V||V|}$ with length $|V|^2$. Since $2^k\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ is the largest integer in the codomain of $w$ and $2^k$ has length $k$ in binary, if we assume that, for the sake of a worst case encoding, $\forall v\in V, w(v)=2^k$, then the length of encoding of a vertex weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$ will be worst case less than $k|V|^2$. Hence, time as a function of the length of the encoding of the input in binary can be written as $O(k|V|^2)$. Alternatively, if we did not want to represent $G$ as an adjacency matrix, and we had some machine configured to read a weighted graph as an input string, we could shorten a tight upper bound on input time as a function of length to $O(|E|+k|V|)$.

For a maximum weighted independent set, let $x_i=1$ if $i\in \{i:v_i\in V'\}$, and $x_i=0$ otherwise. Now, the optimization problem can be stated as:

$$
maximize\ \sum_{i=1}^{|V|}w(v_i)x_i\ s.t.\ \forall (v_i,v_j)\in E, x_i+x_j\leq 1
$$

Equivalently, for all solutions to this problem, the following holds for a clique $U\subseteq V$

$$
\sum_{u_i\in U}x_i\leq 1
$$

Taking the inequality above, we may use 0-1 integer programming to compute the solution to this problem, where a solution in polynomial time is attainable if this instance of 0-1 integer programming is in NP.

# Solution

**Theorem.** The following 0-1 integer programming problem is in NP:

Take our encoded binary string representation of the graph $G=(V,E,w)$ as an adjacency matrix
$M=m_{11}m_{12}...m_{|V|1}...m_{1|V|}...m_{|V||V|}$. Consider the clique $U$ satisfying $\sum_{u_i\in U}x_i\leq 1$, and set every entry of $m_{ij}\in M$ to zero if $m_{ij}\notin U$. Now, find a vector $x$ such that the following element-wise comparison holds:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
m_{11} & m_{12} & \dots & m_{1|V|} \\
m_{21} & m_{22} & \dots & m_{2|V|} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
m_{|V|1} & m_{|V|2} & \dots & m_{|V||V|}
\end{bmatrix}
x\leq \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ \vdots\\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

_Proof._ Take the above as a decision problem with certificate vector $x$. The left of the above inequality is computable in $O(|V|^2)$, and the element-wise comparison to verify whether the inequality holds is $O(|V|)$. Thus, the certificate for this problem can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine that takes $M$ concatenated with a binary encoding of $U$ as input, making this an NP problem.

Therefore, in the event of the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy, finding an independent set $V'\subseteq V$ that maximizes $\sum_{v\in V'}w(v)$ is computable in polynomial time. For an alternative approach, we could say that if $U$ is a Hamiltonian cycle of odd cardinality,

$$
\sum_{u_i\in U}x_i\leq \frac{|U|-1}{2}
$$

Taking the above and previous inequalities, we can compute a solution to the maximum independent set problem using the Gomory cutting plane algorithm, which is likely not computable in polynomial time if $P\neq NP$, but it has promise for finding solutions in a more practical scenario.
